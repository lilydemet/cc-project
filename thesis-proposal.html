    <p style="font-size: 13pt; margin-left: 35%;">DEEP MAPPING in VANCOUVER a praxis-based cartography of being here, now </p>
    <br>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7">
        Some grey day last winter I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around UBC campus. Sunshine is a precious
        thing here in Vancouver where the cloud cover gets so dense that a dimple of white is the only indication our
        star exists. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There’s a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a
        non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles
        encrust the rocks and molluscs collect in crunchy bundles. In and out came the waves and I breathed with them.
        On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun
        psychedelic spirals. This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of
        a bubble are interfered with by waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and
        refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with
        those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colours. Deep mapping is
        constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is the basemap. Mapping deeply requires entering
        the landscape––putting one’s self into the field––and emerging to render a cartography beyond the monochrome.

        For my master’s thesis I will (continue to) practice deep mapping (in) Vancouver. Deep mapping is not
        constitutive of a cartography itself. Rather, it is a capacious practice of deviating from conventional ways of
        <span style="font-style: italic">moving through</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">engaging with</span>
        space. In this way, my thesis is practice-based: I aim to generate new
        knowledge by means of a creative practice. Because an understanding of the context and significance of
        practice-based research claims requires direct reference to the original creative work<sup>1</sup>, I invoke
        research-creation to support the output of my project including a collage of renderings. How this will be
        presented I have yet to decide… will it be material, sewn together like a quilt? or will I weave my encounters
        into the github space I’m building? or, could I curate an exhibition––a constructed space of spatial
        re/constructions? My thesis is also practice-led in that I am developing my own deep mapping practice as I go. I
        aim to evolve my manifesto for mapping negative space into a manifesto for my thesis praxis, a sort of
        self-directive for doing geography in the place where I am.

        Deep mapping reveals unpredictable cartographies and therefore requires from me, the bricoleur-as-researcher, a
        methodological eclecticism.<sup>2</sup> I draw particularly from psychogeography and rhythmanalysis, both
        practices which explore, albeit the latter more theoretically, the affect and sensorium of the city.
        Psychogeography attends to the ways in which urban geographies effect human emotions and behaviour.<sup>3</sup>
        One method of psychogeography is dérive, meaning drift, which involves walking in a state of surrender to the
        tug and pull of the city’s affective contours. Dérive as a mode of deep mapping excites me for its
        “playful-constructive behavior”<sup>4</sup> is just what I mean by constructive interference. Slightly more
        distanced, observing from the balcony or a bridge say, is the rhythmanalsyst. Theorised by Henri Lefebvre, “the
        rhythmanalyst calls on all his [or their] senses” and “thinks with his [or their] body, not in the abstract, but
        in lived temporality.”<sup>5</sup> Deep mapping requires just this kind of presence. He writes of rhythms as the
        music of the city. Like (re)mapping the city through psychogeography, “... to grasp a rhythm it is necessary to
        have been grasped by it; one must let oneself go, give oneself over, abandon oneself to its
        duration.”<sup>6</sup> I want to feel the city.

    <p>The content of my thesis output is as follows:</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7">
        An introduction where I reflect on what drives my curiosity forward and my aims in this project. I will
        introduce the city as my field. Reading like a short story, this autoethnographic introduction to counter
        cartography will be no longer than 2,000 words. My framework section will put into conversation the literatures,
        disciplines, practitioners, and cartographies I draw theoretical, conceptual, practical, and creative
        inspiration from. Towards the end of this section, totalling approximately 7,000 words, I will introduce my now
        situated thesis concept and address the privileges and limitations of my work. In my manifesto for praxis I will
        articulate how the concepts from my framework will be mobilised by my own practice of deep mapping. I will
        evolve this (2,500 word) section throughout my project, committing changes as I go to github so as to make
        process part of product. A significant element of my thesis will be a collage of creative cartographies from
        deep mapping. The medium(s) of presentation are still inchoate, though not for lack of ideas. Developing my
        framework through the fall will make concrete-enough the form/content of my creative artefact. I will conclude
        my project with a (5,000 word) discussion of my gleanings and my project’s relevance. I will also speak to what
        I learned from the process, how I grew as a spatial being, and where my curiosity is driving me next.
