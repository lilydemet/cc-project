<h4>EXPANDING THE MONOCHROME deep mapping as constructive interference</h4>
<p>

    On campus one characteristically Vancouver grey day I walked the stretch of shoreline between wreck and tower beach.
    Sunshine is a precious thing here where the cloud cover gets so dense that a dimple of white is the only indication our
    star exists. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There’s a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a
    non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the
    rocks and molluscs collect in crunchy bundles. In and out came the waves and I breathed with them. On each exhale I
    noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This
    happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of the bubble are interfered with by
    waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of
    incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to
    make visible an abundance of colours. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is
    the basemap. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s body into the field––and emerging to produce
    a cartography beyond the monochrome.
