        i began constructing this space on a whim, knowing nothing of github but immensly inspirerd by the page of <a
            href="https://sultanazana.github.io/">Sultana Zana (found here).</a> The way they shared their mindscape
        inspired me to build out my own. however, i knew nothing of github and very little html. with the internet,
        though, one can teach themselves anything. i learned as i went, "making as/through thinking and thinking
        as/through making"––a practice fundemental to the creative humanities <a
            href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538147733/Critical-Concepts-for-the-Creative-Humanities"> (van der Tuin
            and Verhoeff 2022, 2-3.)</a>

        this page began as a place to host my counter cartography/ies of negative space/s, though i soon realized my
        proof of concept was inextricable from the process that created (and is still creating) it. so i began to
        database my mind, moving between multiple scales until i had created a scaffolding for projects like Mapping
        Negative Space.
        the question of what platform to render my map with had been troubling me for it seemed all
        options that were ready-made would, by their UI and UX, define the structure of my map and how others could
        interact with it. throwing it all on github adds a level of transparency and interactivity that an arcgis
        storymap could not. i want to de-emphasize the product, instead situating it within the context of its process.
        with github, i get to build the space my maps and all the thinking leading up to it will inhabit. whats more,
        github commits make visible my construction process. go to <a
            href="https://github.com/lilydemet/lilydemet.github.io/blob/main/about.html">this page</a>
        and see its structure in html. alternatively, right click where you are and 'inspect' to get a side by side view
        of the page you are seeing and the page your web browser is reading. (you might have to click the little grey
        traingles to expand the elements.)
        <br>
        <br>
        that all being said, my limited capacity means i cannot always make appear what i want. so i improvise, work
        around, and even change directions. too much right now is linear. you land on the index page where i have given
        you 2 choices: go to DEEP_MAPPING or FIELD_NOTES. from there on i provide a directory in the upper corner so you
        can 'go somewhere else.' however, it becomes difficult to remember where you are in relation to other places in
        the space, and thus how they build on one another. im not yet able to script dynamic content. i do with
        embedding files and hyperlinking words so that you can click away to another site.

        this page is a work-in-progress as much as its content is my work-in-process. so, feel welcome to reach me
        through spacetime at ldemet@student.ubc.ca with questions, suggestions, and critique.
