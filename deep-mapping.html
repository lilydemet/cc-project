    <h4>EXPANDING THE MONOCHROME deep mapping as constructive interference</h4>
    <p>
        On campus one characteristically Vancouver grey day I walked the stretch of shoreline between wreck and tower
        beach.
        Sunshine is a precious thing here where the cloud cover gets so dense that a dimple of white is the only
        indication our
        star exists. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There’s a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a
        non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles
        encrust the
        rocks and molluscs collect in crunchy bundles. In and out came the waves and I breathed with them. On each
        exhale I
        noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic
        spirals. This
        happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of the bubble are interfered
        with by
        waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of
        incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere
        constructively to
        make visible an abundance of colours. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection
        that is
        the basemap. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s body into the field––and emerging to
        produce
        a cartography beyond the monochrome.

            The fixity and abstraction of the cartographic frame (the map) belie the
            unboundedly complex, contingent and temporal spatialities of “the field”. The deep map is a
            utopian imaginary of space inasmuch as it strives to frame or in some way open itself up to that which is
            “lived”. By
            contrast, the thin map (if we can accept, for a moment, this oppositional conceit) is unapologetically
            representational:
            it is a representation of space that is ill- or, at least, under-equipped when it comes to servicing the
            needs of those
            whose inclinations are to “dive within” <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/5/1/5/htm"> (Roberts 2016,
                4).</a></span>

    <p>Deep mapping is praxis. It "cannot be reduced to the otherwise a-spatial and a-temporal
        domain of the (deep) map” <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/5/1/5/htm">
            (Roberts 2016, 3).</a> The performance-process of deep mapping constitutes itself counter cartography for it
        resists conventional
        ways of
        <span style="font-style: italic;">moving through</span> space by embracing slowness, disorientation, and the use
        of
        senses beyond the visual. Creative cartographies most aptly render the encounters (points), connections (lines),
        and
        landscapes (polygons) discovered through mapping deeply.</p>
