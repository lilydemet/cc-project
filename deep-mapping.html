        EXPANDING THE MONOCHROME deep mapping as constructive interference
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        On campus one characteristically Vancouver grey day I walked the stretch of shoreline between wreck and tower beach.
        Sunshine is a precious thing here where the cloud cover gets so dense that a dimple of white is the only indication our
        star exists. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There’s a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a
        non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the
        rocks and molluscs collect in crunchy bundles. In and out came the waves and I breathed with them. On each exhale I
        noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This
        happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of the bubble are interfered with by
        waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of
        incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to
        make visible an abundance of colours. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is
        the basemap. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s body into the field––and emerging to produce
        a cartography beyond the monochrome.

        Deep mapping is praxis: 
        <br><br>
        <span style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;">“Deep mapping, in other words, cannot
            be reduced to the otherwise a-spatial and a-temporal
        domain of the (deep) map. It denotes an anthropology of practice. People are doing things when they engage in deep
        mapping; what it is they are doing becomes the focus of a spatial anthropology: a culture of mapping practice” <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/5/1/5/htm">
        (2016, 3).</a></span>
        <br>
        My process, methods, and doing of the cartography are therefore part and parcel of my creative output. 

        " The lived, everyday, and performative, therefore, is the ‘space’ within and from which the world—our world, this
        world, any given world we are speaking towards—erupts into being."

        *as praxis (process is performance is processs -BP) -> research creation and arts based research

        *as slowing down part of appreciationg process - -- slow scholarship --"Slowing down involves resisting neoliberal regimes of harried time by working with care while also caring for ourselves and others. "
