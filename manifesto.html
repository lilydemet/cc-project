        <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A MANIFESTO for mapping negative space</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        a Manifesto is a declaration.
        <br>
        <br>
        you navigated to this page and are reading these words because I declared the document in which they are written
        to be html.
        <br>
        <br>
        the Manifesto of this Manifesto is: <span style="font-weight: bold;">&ltDOCTYPE html&gt.</span>
        <!--well, only one of us can read that-->
        (right click here and choose "inspect" to see what i mean!)
        <!--hello from the other side!-->
        <br>
        <br>
        a document's declaration allows a web browser (like google chrome, apple safari, or mozilla firefox) to read its
        contents and display it according to the rules of its language. if not for &ltDOCTYPE html&gt, what you are reading would
        not exist.
        <br>
        <br>
        just as a document declaration makes my html file legible to a web browser, my Manifesto For Mapping Negative
        Space provides me, the web (and urban) flâneur, a language with which to communicate my ideas. it articulates a
        framework which brings form to an otherwise indefinite concept.
        <br>
        <br>
        in what follows I provide directive, though no direction. wander and wonder as you will. after all, thats how
        this counter-cartography began.<br>
        <br>

        <!--AVOID THE SUBJECT<br>-->
        a sticker on a lamppost in gastown offers the first rule for mapping negative space:
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">AVOID THE SUBJECT.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        negative space is a concept that, in art, refers to space surrounding the subject––space that is necessary in
        order for the subject to exist but which is not the intended focus of attention.
        <br>
        <br>
        take a map of vancouver that serves navigational purposes, like google maps or the paper ones you can take for
        free at waterfront station. the subject of these maps are roads, followed by differently-shaded polygons which
        <br>
        signify the buildings, green space, and water which (according to the map) make up the city. if roads are the
        subject then alleyways are relegated to negative space. to render vancouver by mapping its alleyways is to avoid
        the subject, shifting focus to spaces in-between and in so doing, creating a counter-cartography of and for new
        navigations.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So0ZrTwf8vI">SLOW DOWN</a></span><br>
        Day to day we use maps to find our way about. We use digital maps to find out when the next bus is coming and how long it will take me to get
        where we are to where we are going. But if there were no destination, what would the journey be like?
