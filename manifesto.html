        <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A MANIFESTO for mapping negative space</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        a Manifesto is a declaration.
        <br>
        <br>
        you navigated to this page and are reading these words because I declared the document in which they are written
        to be html.
        <br>
        <br>
        the Manifesto of this Manifesto is: <span style="font-weight: bold;">&ltDOCTYPE html&gt</span>
        <!--well, only one of us can read that-->
        (right click here and choose "inspect" to see what i mean).
        <!--hello from the other side!-->
        <br>
        <br>
        a document's declaration allows a web browser (like google chrome, apple safari, or mozilla firefox) to read its
        contents and display it according to the rules of its language. if not for &ltDOCTYPE html&gt, what you are
        reading would
        not exist here.
        <br>
        <br>
        just as a document declaration makes my html file legible to a web browser, my Manifesto For Mapping Negative
        Space provides me, the web (and urban) flâneur, a language with which to communicate what it is i do. it
        articulates a
        framework which brings form to an otherwise indefinite concept.
        <br>
        <br>
        in what follows I provide directive, though no direction. wander and wonder as you will. go forth and glean.
        that's all im really doing.<br>

        <!--AVOID THE SUBJECT<br>-->
        a sticker on a lamppost in gastown offers the first directive for mapping negative space:
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">AVOID THE SUBJECT.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        negative space is a concept that, in art, refers to that which surrounds the subject––space that is necessary in
        order for the subject to exist but which is not the intended focus of attention. <br>in writing, negative space
        is whitespace. its all that the words are not. its in the margins and the distance between a period and capital
        letter. creative writing and poetry in particular engage (with) the page in ways that incorperate space into the
        creative work itself. the space left empty carries value beyond legibility. it gives room for the reader to sit
        with what words have evoked. creative forms of writing are well suited to render encounters of deep mapping as
        they
        allow for juxtaposition and the dissolution of space/time linearity. Anachronisms and anachorisms allow multiple
        realities to be woven together.
        <!--links - that that is there but beyond- a leap(whether in imagination, or a link)-->
        <br>
        <br>
        <!--take a map of vancouver that serves navigational purposes, like google maps or the paper ones you can take for
        free at waterfront station. the subject of these maps are roads, followed by differently-shaded polygons which
        signify the buildings, green space, and water which (according to the map) make up the city. if roads are the
        subject then alleyways are relegated to negative space. to render vancouver by mapping its alleyways is to avoid
        the subject, shifting focus to spaces in-between and in so doing, creating a counter-cartography of and for new
        navigations.

                TIME</a></span><br>
        Day to day we use maps to find our way about. We use digital maps to find out when the next bus is coming and
        how long it will take me to get where we are to where we are going. But if there were no destination, what would
        the journey be like? Mapping negative space requires slowing down in order to be <span
            style="font-style: italic">with </span>the landscape
        rather than merely moving through it. By taking my time, i am practicing <a

        is just the beggining––a proof of concept, where concept is inchoate and proof subjective.

                FOR THE LOVELY UNEXPECTED</a></span>
        this directive i take from <a
            href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andie-nordgren-the-short-instructional-manifesto-for-relationship-anarchy">The
            short instructional manifesto for relationship anarchy, by Andie Nordgren.</a> Within the framework of
        relationshiip anarchy, to build for the lovely unexpected is to be open...
        open to the unexpected, the unplanned. it is to express oneself freely.
        in my counter cartographic practice of deep mapping, building for the lovely unexpected means centering
        exploration,
        opening myself to the serendipitous and, above all else, <span style="font-weight: bold;">"being free to be
            spontaneous".</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Mapping Negative Space is a cartography of in-betweens––spaces, places, sensations, lifeworlds, ways of being,
        and processes (rhythms?) that shape
        conventionally intended objects of focus though are seldom mapped in their own right. Because deep mapping is a
        counter cartographic praxis rather than a kind of counter map,
        what i have here digitized is an assemblage of articulations, a spatial bricolage of my gleanings.
        <br>
        <br>
        my effort is inspired by the Humanities special issue <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/5/1/5/htm">
            Spatial Bricolage: Methodological Eclecticism and the Poetics of “Making Do”</a>.  Les Roberts' editorial (and writings elsewhere on deep mapping, spatial anthroplogy, and covert ethnography)
        in particular introduced me to a viable way of being a bricoleur in academia.
