        A MANIFESTO for mapping negative space<br><br><br>
        a Manifesto is a declaration. <br><br>
        you navigated to this page and are reading these words because<br>
        I declared the document in which they are written to be html.<br>
        the Manifesto of this Manifesto is: &ltDOCTYPE html&gt.<br> <!--well, only one of us can read that-->
        right click here and choose "inspect" to see what i mean! <!--hello from the other side!-->
        a document's declaration allows a web browser <br>
        (like google chrome, apple safari, or mozilla firefox)<br>
        to read its contents and display it according to the rules of its language.<br>
        if not for &ltDOCTYPE html&gt, this place would not exist. <br>
        <br>
        just as a document declaration makes my html file legible to a web browser,<br> 
        my Manifesto For Mapping Negative Space provides me, the web (and urban) flâneur,<br>
        a language with which to communicate my ideas.<br> 
        it articulates a framework which brings form to an otherwise indefinite concept.<br>
        <br>
        in what follows I provide directive, though no direction. <br>
        wander and wonder as you will. after all, thats how this counter-cartography began.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        AVOID THE SUBJECT<br>
        a sticker on a street-post in gastown offers the first rule for mapping negative space.<br>
        avoid the subject. <br>
        negative space is a concept that, in art,<br>
        refers to space surrounding the subject––<br>
        space that is necessary in order for the subject to exist<br> 
        but which is not the intended focus of attention.<br>
        take a map of vancouver that serves navigational purposes, like google maps or<br> 
        the paper ones you can take for free at waterfront station.<br>
        the subject of these maps are roads, followed by differently-shaded polygons which <br> 
        signify the buildings, green space, and water which (according to the map) make up the city.<br>
        if roads are the subject then alleyways are relegated to negative space.<br> 
        to render vancouver by mapping its alleyways is to avoid the subject, shifting focus to spaces in-between<br> 
        and in so doing, creating a counter-cartography of and for new navigations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        SLOW DOWN
        <br>
        INTERFERE CONSTRUCTIVELY<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        EMBRACE DISORIENTATION
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        why i use github - working from both sides. also commits transparent. not using constraiints of platnform. evolve. no currated way to move through space
        <br>
        theorize negative space, conceptualize a lost poem<br>
        map here as proof of concept - intent to develop framework/ideas for deep mapping<br>
