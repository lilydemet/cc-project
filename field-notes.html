    <!--ABSTRACT TO CONCRETE-->
    <p>
        One day my friend and I are walking along a familiar street and see, resting amongst the regular fairy
        pebbles and kitsch that decorate the bases of so many chestnut trees in this neighborhood, a box of chalk.
        It’s an open-ended invitation to which we respond by pausing to draw colorful forms on the sidewalk. “Very
        affirming” comments a passerby as they smile and skirt around us. In this moment, we have transformed an
        otherwise pedestrian space into a place of interest, using what mediums surround us to engage with the city
        and its passersby.

    <br>
    <p>
        days later we walked the same sidewalk and saw the weathered impression dissolving back to abstraction. i
        wonder how many soles picked up pieces of chalk and how far our art walked with them.

        I begin writing for my thesis in a place I come to often - usually late in the morning with a smoke and a
        couple hours uninterrupted thinking behind me. From where I stand now I see at once the
        hazy outline of mountains above downtown's quiet skyscrapers, the subway construction at Broadway & Cambie
        that exposes the guts of the city while slowing traffic and reconfiguring pedestrian flows, and, directly below
        me, people walking rolling and riding about their day.<br><br>

        I like places that offer me perspective, like this spot, or the rooftop parkade of the supermarket two blocks
        from
        here or Granville Bridge. Places above the ground offer an alternate framing of what goes on <i>in</i> the city
        - the
        field in which I practice deep mapping. The sensorium is less overwhelming up here. Less abrasive. Bodily
        distanced, I feel less. Vertically distanced, I see more. The places I have Been fall into some geospatial
        context. (The surest method of developing spatial awareness, however, is getting lost on the ground.) From such
        a vantage, the city and my thesis are more
        easily theorized. I'll take out my notebook or my voice recorder and let the ideas flow. <i>Later I'll write
            these up and push them to <field-notes class="html"></field-notes> on <lilydemet class="github io">
            </lilydemet>
            I say.</i> Today is the first time I write in this place in this place. (Well, I just moved a few feet to a
        stone bench to let a skater boy eat his dinner sitting perched on the very edge. I have stood there for 2 hours
        after all. He's playing Bad Bunny which isn't this entry's mood so I'll wrap up this entry for today.) Tl;dr:
        Ive
        written here so many times but
        with nothing to show (you). Today I write directly on my laptop as
        the sun sets against a thousand windows and the chill of a second fall has me wondering where all the time
        went.
    </p>
    <!---So I begin writing my fieldnotes, here, here, and from the middle. I will talk about the beginning - and times
        between then and (the evolving) now - but a linear account at this point would be an exercise in memory rather
        than mind. I trust my ideas will connect down the road (though along which road ill be walking when it all comes
        together i dont know). I started fieldwork the day after I arrived in Vancouver. 449 days ago I walked down
        Highbury, the crossroad closest to my first room - all 30 blocks to the water. No phone; no map. No notion of
        Vancouver's geography. For someone who drove across a continent to another coutry for a graduate program in
        geography its odd that i did absolutely no research of the city where i decided to go on a whim. hills. so many
        hills. suburbs? in the city? mansions - each one with a different architectural style.

        The city is hazy and so am I. I wake up late, spend till noon fighting the stupor of sleeping pills. Insomnia
        comes in waves; I pray it ebbs. I do five things at once without thinking: I wash the dishes while
        putting away glasses. I drop them all, I sweep them up and the faucet is still running. I try to eat. I choke.
        I'm unable to
        swallow like my body is rejecting input. I'm out of breath. My senses dulled. I'm lost in familiar
        places. I wander around listening to <i>You want it darker</i> on repeat. The mountains have disappeared and
        even downtown is
        fading away. I think I've opened myself so wide to the rhythms of this city that when it's hazy so am I.

        i moved to vancouver less than a year ago and then moved again within the city around the same time as i
        began this project. i drove to vancouver from the other side of the continent via somewhere in the middle of
        the
        united states. for the first time in my life i left without a plan. i had no map save a Rand McNally Atlas
        of U.S. Road Atlas
        which i am embarrased to say i forsook in favor of googles maps. even then, however, my journey unfolded in
        ways i never could have imagined and so slowly, i
        became comfortable with being uncomfortable. with not knowing what lies ahead and not trying (too hard) to.
        so much can happen between departure and destination. yet when the goal of a journey is the destination
        alone, getting lost is experienced as an inconvienence. therefore, maps are used to plot a path from A to B,
        departure to destination. with digital maps such as google maps, GPS will geolocate you in caresian space so
        long as you remain in range of sattelite reception.
        follow the directions spoken in synthesized sentences and you won't ever have to feel disoriented. you can't
        get lost. [recalculating...] you can't get lost

        my journey to vancouver, into graduate school, and through this project until now has been a process of
        disoriented discovery. everything between departure and destination shapes where you end up. yet so long as
        the academy valorizes
        product over process, mindmaps will remain counter cartography. because deep mapping is a counter
        cartographic praxis, so much of what went into articulating the negative spaces assembled above risks being
        relegated itself to negative space.

        I take the 33 bus to campus as a treat - something different, outside routine. It takes me through places I've
        been before
        but have yet to connect via this navigation. The city is daily reinvented in my imagination. It emerges for me
        not through
        place making alone but through connections drawn by my movement between areas of familiarity. Lines between
        points expand out
        into planes of contingent perception which layer and stretch to pinch and intersect with one another. <br> I
        write this first as it comes to me in the whitespace of <i>A brief history of my body</i> by Billy-Ray Belcourt.
        I brought it with me because I woke up resonating with what he writes of care:<br><br>
        <span class="quote">"Care doesn't
            easily retrieve us
            from the fragilities of cohabitation; it plunges us into a zone where everything shape-shifts, where
            everything
            is a potential site of severance and construction... Care is a disruptive thing because it frees the
            analytic of
            the world from a state that is overdetermined. And so, those of us who still want love in the couple form
            dwell
            in the instabilities of caring for that which also has the power to undo us. But always, with care, we
            perform
            high-stakes processes of world-making––in the hope that, in our dying days, we might feel freer" (Belcourt
            2020,
            123-124).</span><br>

        Each time I leave home I carefully select which books to bring with me, not because I will necessarily read
        them, but more because I like their company. I bring along the people/stories/concepts I wish to think
        with for the day. Often I bring more than one book. Today I have also Lefebvre's <i>Rhythmanalysis</i> (almost
        always with me), <i>A Manifesto for Research-Creation</i>> by Natalie Loveless, and <i>Invisible Cities</i>> by
        Italo Calvino. My all time favorites. I like to put texts into conversation first amongst themselves. In my bag
        they rest against one another, interlap even with one a bookmark for the other.
        Books read me as I read them. I open myself as I open them: read me. What else is there to say?
        <br>
        <br>
        Later in the day I'm sitting outside with the same book, writing this. A stranger approaches me and asks me
        about it. He says I'm the only person he's seen today using a physical book. We get to talking. He's in his
        eighties, never travelled, says he talks instead to all sorts of people to build an understanding of the wider
        world. He offers me advice: something about detours being an important part of the journey. Be open. 
        <br>
        Taking the 33 instead of the 99 B-Line to campus was a detour from my habitual route. I'd never taken the 33 before but I think I will again.
