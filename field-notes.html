        field_notes is a juxtaposition of ideas in no particular order. maybe when i figure out
        how to build this page nonlinearly i can better convey their inter-relation.
        nothing here is self-contained. this page is in evolution. its
        unfinished and uncertain. a collage, my field notes constitute themselves a field from which i draw out the basis for
        some critical-creative construction.
