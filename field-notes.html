        field_notes is a collage of ideas in no particular order. its linearity carries no inherent meaning - form
        here is simply the result of my limited coding ability.
        this page is in constant evolution (see commit history). here is where i pin up some ideas i have while walking
        and
        encounters that made me think.

            One day my friend and I are walking along a familiar street and see, resting amongst the regular fairy
            pebbles and kitsch that decorate the bases of so many chestnut trees in this neighborhood, a box of chalk.
            It’s an open-ended invitation to which we respond by pausing to draw colorful forms on the sidewalk. “Very
            affirming” comments a passerby as they smile and skirt around us. In this moment, we have transformed an
            otherwise pedestrian space into a place of interest, using what mediums surround us to engage with the city
            and its passersby.

        float:left; padding: 10px; 
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 55%"><br>
            days later we walked the same sidewalk and saw the weathered impression dissolving back to abstraction. i
            wonder how many soles picked up pieces of chalk and how far our art walked with them.
