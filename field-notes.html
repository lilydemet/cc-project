        here is where i draft and synthesize my fieldnotes.
        because my toolkit contains an eclectic set of methods and technologies,
        my initial (raw) data is spread across multiple devices and file formats.
        in this space i juxtapose ideas and let them simmer.
        entries come in no particular order. maybe when i figure out
        how to build this page nonlinearly i can better convey their inter-relation.
        like the thoughts in my mind, nothing here is self-contained. rather, i'm constantly building, iterating,
        synthesizing,
        moving on, and returning, to places/practices/concepts/theories. Write <a

            The <span style="font-style: italic;">creative</span> aspect in creative humanities takes shape in the
            (literally) productive connection between making
            practices and thinking practices: making as&sol;through thinking and thinking as&sol;through making. These
            generative
            practices are emphatically experimental and comfortable with knowledge production in uncertainty,
            multiplicity, and
            friction. Thinking with, through, and beyond concepts, creative humanities projects are creative in
            designing and
            developing their own methods and approaches as they seek to navigate and explore the productive connections
            and reciprocal relationships between the creative practices they engage with and
            to develop conceptual analytical approaches for what these practices also work with, through, or beyond.

        here is where i offer insight into my process of thinking/making into being various projects in the creative humanities.
        right now my focus is on deep mapping and the making of a lost poem of vancouver. this page is in evolution. its
        unfinished and uncertain. a collage, my field notes constitute themselves a field from which i draw out the basis for
        some construction.

        EXPANDING THE MONOCHROME deep mapping as constructive interference
    </h4>
   <!--<p>what if here instead was talking about screen mediation
        On campus one characteristically Vancouver grey day I walked the stretch of shoreline between wreck and tower beach.
        Sunshine is a precious thing here where the cloud cover gets so dense that a dimple of white is the only indication our
        star exists. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There’s a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a
        non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the
        rocks and molluscs collect in crunchy bundles. In and out came the waves and I breathed with them. On each exhale I
        noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This
        happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of the bubble are interfered with by
        waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of
        incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to
        make visible an abundance of colours. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is
        the basemap. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s body into the field––and emerging to produce
        a cartography beyond the monochrome.
