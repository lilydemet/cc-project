        my toolkit contains all the ways of learning, creating, and presenting i know of. its all the workflows and
        work-arounds that have developed by necessesity. some processes are messy at first, like how i download .WMA files
        from my voice recorder and upload them to an online conversion platform where i can converrt them to .mp3 files which i download
        to my flashdrive where i must of course sort them based on based on date (or content? and how do I name them?).

        my toolkit contains methods and materials i bring with me to the field as well as those skills and technologies that i
        use to transcribe & transform all that i collect into something share-able. my toolkit is dynamic, rearranging to suit
        the situation at hand. this is what methodological eclecticism is about. <a

        PLATFORMS & TECHNOLOGIES i employ for mapping include Github, ArcGIS Online, Adobe Illustrator, Garageband, and iMovie.
        MATERIALS include pens, crayons, pencils, post-it-notes, notebooks, copy paper, cellphone, voice recorder, laptop,
        thumbdrive, extension cords and dongles.<br><br>
        INFRASTRUCTURES include the internet, roads sidewalks and public transit. i also rely on the network of
        friends and colleagues around me whose consistent support, encouragement, and solidarity makes doing what i do
        sustainable. our conversations are always a source of inspiration, pushing me to think beyond what i could ever conceive
        of alone.<br><br>
        SKILLS: computational thinking. thinking in multiple scales. troubleshooting. crative problem solving. teaching myself
        how to do something using online documentation. identifying tools/methods/workflows relevent to the objective at hand.
