        my toolkit is all the ways of learning, creating, and presenting i know of. its all the workflows and
        work-arounds that have developed by necessesity. some processes are messy at first, like how i download .WMA files
        from my voice recorder and upload them to an online conversion platform where i can converrt them to .mp3 files which i download
        to my flashdrive where i must of course sort them based on based on date (or content? and how do I name them?).

        my toolkit contains methods and materials i bring with me to the field as well as those skills and technologies that i
        use to transcribe & transform all that i collect into something share-able. my toolkit is dynamic, rearranging to suit
        the situation at hand. this is what methodological eclecticism is about. <a
