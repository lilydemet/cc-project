            **so i have my idea and i have my data but i cannot figure out a good way to make it work in the digital
            space yet. ive tried a bunch of ways but nothing works the way i want. still thinking about it.

            oh, to lost poem point - cite Banazek in discussion about how white space of the page is like, negative
            space, wanderiing in the margins, in white space -
            <br>
            <br>
            This from my initial project proposal: <Br>My counter-cartography in its material form will be a 2D (if
            digital) or 3D (if physical) ‘basemap’ from which windows will be cut, gaps through which creative
            cartographies produced by mapping deeply will be explorable. I will render these pockets of affect through
            narratives, poetry, audio/visuals, and imaginative sketches. The form of my counter-cartography is opposite
            to that of a found poem: I am uncovering places on the existing page/basemap/space that together create
            their own poem/mapping/place. It plays with the concept of negative space, a term in art that refers to
            space surrounding the subject––space that is necessary in order for the subject to exist but which is not
            the intended focus of attention. (The view from Lions gate is spectacular, but what if I focused instead on
            the rumbling of cars and the rhythms that reverberate in my body? I dip my fingers in the ocean and feel the
            sonic throb of tanker engines.) My counter-cartography will be a lost poem, a collection of negative spaces
            in and around Vancouver that were encountered unintentionally, felt deeply, and which coalesce to form an
            affective map of this place I’ve begun to call home.
