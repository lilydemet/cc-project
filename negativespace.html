            doodles my friend and i drew together with chalk on the sidewalk as passersby stopped to say things like "very affirming" the chalk
            was found in a plastic container at the foot of a tree––one of the many offerings put out in the
            neighborhood i guess to spark the creativity of those who walk by. drawing on the sidewalk turned it from a
            path underfoot to a piece of art which people stepped around and even moved them to share kind words.

            days later we walked the same sidewalk and saw the weathered impression dissolving back to abstraction. i wonder how many soles picked up pieces of chalk and how far our art walked with them.

                an idea that didn't fully work out was to cut up a map i had according to places that are important to me in vancouver, and then sew them back on to a canvas along with other collaged materials. perhaps a future project.

                thoughts)</span><br>
            i moved to vancouver less than a year ago and then moved again within the city around the same time as i
            began this project. i drove to vancouver from the other side of the continent via somewhere in the middle of
            the
            united states. for the first time in my life i left without a plan. i had no map save a Rand McNally Atlas
            of U.S. Road Atlas
            which i am embarrased to say i forsook in favor of googles maps. even then, however, my journey unfolded in
            ways i never could have imagined and so slowly, i
            became comfortable with being uncomfortable. with not knowing what lies ahead and not trying (too hard) to.
            so much can happen between departure and destination. yet when the goal of a journey is the destination
            alone, getting lost is experienced as an inconvienence. therefore, maps are used to plot a path from A to B,
            departure to destination. with digital maps such as google maps, GPS will geolocate you in caresian space so
            long as you remain in range of sattelite reception.
            follow the directions spoken in synthesized sentences and you won't ever have to feel disoriented. you can't
            get lost. [recalculating...] you can't get lost

            <br>
            <br>
            my journey to vancouver, into graduate school, and through this project until now has been a process of
            disoriented discovery. everything between departure and destination shapes where you end up. yet so long as
            the academy valorizes
            product over process, mindmaps will remain counter cartography. because deep mapping is a counter
            cartographic praxis, so much of what went into articulating the negative spaces assembled above risks being
            relegated itself to negative space.

            to intentionally disorient oneself, to get
            lost as method, to slow down, to be guided by serendipidy, to follow non-linear tradjectories,
            to start something and start over. and over. and over and then claim that all this not only <span
                style="font-style: italic">informs</span> that which has coalesced as creative-output but actually <span
                style="font-style: italic">constitutes</span> the research product is bold but, as i learned recently
            from a former classmate, not without precedent.
            a former classmate introduced me to research-creation which introduced me to
            practice-based research:
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;">Practice-based Research is
                an original investigation undertaken in order to gain new
                knowledge partly by means of practice and the outcomes of that practice. In a doctoral thesis,
                claims of originality and contribution to knowledge may be demonstrated through creative
                outcomes in the form of designs, music, digital media, performances and exhibitions. Whilst
                the significance and context of the claims are described in words, a full understanding can
                only be obtained with direct reference to the outcomes. <a

            "<span style="font-style: italic;">practice-based</span> research generates new knowledge through or by
            means of artistic practice itself" writes Natalie Loveless in her introduction to <a
                href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/how-to-make-art-at-the-end-of-the-world">How to Make Art at the End of
                the World.</a> Her manifesto, which i have only just begun but which is already how i want to go about
            my master's thesis, mobilizes research-creation as a practice of remaking the neoliberal university through
            resisting normative ways of rendering academic research public.
            he outcome of my deep mapping practice in vancouver is this page and the above articulations, but it is also
            the
            methods, workflows, and so audio/visual/voice-recorded data i created while mapping deeply.
            i include here just some of my process, though for future works my intention is to pay closer attention to
            what i do and how i do it in order to render process all the more legible as part and parcel of my
            creative output.

        <p>audio recording of me talking to myself while walking. i took over 100 voice memos on my recorder. while
            recording myself on my phone makes it easy to simply send the file over internet to my email, then download
            it and upload to a transcription software, i dislike having my phone out while doing fieldwork. i much
            prefer the feel of my <a href="/.toolkit.html">voice recorder </a>which rests discreetly in my palm. to
            recall my thoughts, however, i must first connect the device to my laptop through a connector cable,
            download each file, then run through a free file type converter online so that i can open and edit my
            recordings as mp3s in iMovie. i use otter.ai to transcribe my memos, but can only transcribe 3 files for
            free with each account i create, and must upload clips no longer than 30 minutes. so i string thoughts
            together in iMovie––like by day. keeping track of all the files and back-up copies and developing naming
            conventions is a whole other challenge. then there's the task of reading through everything i wrote.</p>
