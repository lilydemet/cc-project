        <span style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;">
            The <span style="font-style: italic;">creative</span> aspect in creative humanities takes shape in the
            (literally) productive connection between making
            practices and thinking practices: making as&sol;through thinking and thinking as&sol;through making. These
            generative
            practices are emphatically experimental and comfortable with knowledge production in uncertainty,
            multiplicity, and
            friction. Thinking with, through, and beyond concepts, creative humanities projects are creative in
            designing and
            developing their own methods and approaches as they seek to navigate and explore the productive connections
            and reciprocal relationships between the creative practices they engage with and
            to develop conceptual analytical approaches for what these practices also work with, through, or beyond.
