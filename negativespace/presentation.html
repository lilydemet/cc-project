    <h2>CounterMapping Project Presentation - April 8</h2>
    <p> 
        Peers will present their mapping project to the class and attendees. Presentations will be 15-20 min. 
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp-&nbsp&nbspThe maps created
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp-&nbsp&nbspinclude an interactive exercise/portion where peers can interact with or explore the map
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp-&nbsp&nbspThe cartographer’s statement/manifesto describing the purpose of the map
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp-&nbsp&nbspThe process of creating the map (items submitted for the mapping project draft) Learning takeaways, discovers and/or challenges

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Counter Cartography</span>
        <br>
        <br> Mapping Negative Space is a cartography of in-betweens––spaces, places,
            sensations, lifeworlds, ways of being,
            and processes (rhythms?) that shape
            conventionally intended objects of focus though are seldom mapped in their own right. Because deep mapping
            is a
            counter cartographic praxis rather than a kind of counter map,
            what i have here digitized is an assemblage of articulations, a spatial bricolage of my gleanings.

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifesto</span>
            <a href="./manifesto.html" class="button" style="margin-left:46%;">MANIFESTO</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Process --> negative space itself. Slow scholarship and deep mapping emphasize process/practice rather than "creative output"
            methodological eclecticism (eg drawing with chalk on the sidewalk)
            <br>
            in the field this means using video, audio, recording myself, writing, sketching 
            <br>
            when mapping this means using what skills and materials i have around 
            <br>
            <br>
            taught myself github/html as i went along to make this space <a href="./about.html">read more about it here</a><br>
            -commits make process visible as well as digital/code structure of page
            -create space whose limits are my own abilities rather than constraints of pre-formed platform like storymaps
            -always evolving
            -spatial as it involves thinking in multiple scales to organize projects and database my mind
