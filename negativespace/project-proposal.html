<h5>Mapping Negative Space: A Lost Poem of Vancouver</h5>
<h6>Counter-Cartography Project Proposal by Lily Demet Crandall-Oral</h6>
<br>
<p>On campus one characteristically Vancouver grey day I walked the stretch of shoreline between wreck and tower beach. Sunshine is a precious thing here where the cloud cover gets so dense that a dimple of white is the only indication our star exists. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There’s a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs collect in crunchy bundles. In and out came the waves and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of the bubble are interfered with by waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colours. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is the basemap. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s body into the field––and emerging to produce a cartography beyond the monochrome. 
</p><br>
<p>My counter-cartography in its material form will be a 2D (if digital) or 3D (if physical) ‘basemap’ from which windows will be cut, gaps through which creative cartographies produced by mapping deeply will be explorable. I will render these pockets of affect through narratives, poetry, audio/visuals, and imaginative sketches. The form of my counter-cartography is opposite to that of a found poem: I am uncovering places on the existing page/basemap/space that together create their own poem/mapping/place. It plays with the concept of  negative space, a term in art that refers to space surrounding the subject––space that is necessary in order for the subject to exist but which is not the intended focus of attention. (The view from Lions gate is spectacular, but what if I focused instead on the rumbling of cars and the rhythms that reverberate in my body? I dip my fingers in the ocean and feel the sonic throb of tanker engines.) My counter-cartography will be a lost poem, a collection of negative spaces in and around Vancouver that were encountered unintentionally, felt deeply, and which coalesce to form an affective map of this place I’ve begun to call home.

<p>But deep mapping is praxis: “Deep mapping, in other words, cannot be reduced to the otherwise a-spatial and a-temporal domain of the (deep) map. It denotes an anthropology of practice. People are doing things when they engage in deep mapping; what it is they are doing becomes the focus of a spatial anthropology: a culture of mapping practice” (Roberts 2016). My process, methods, and doing of the cartography are therefore part and parcel of my material product. This project is a chance to articulate what I am already doing: drifting around the city with a notebook, crayons, camera, and voice recorder. My praxis embraces disorientation and serendipity. I am continually inspired by Les Roberts’ (2018) editorial for Humanities special issue, "Spatial Bricolage: Methodological Eclecticism and the Poetics of ‘Making Do.’" Every reference made in that paper is informing my direction. He writes of the bricoleur as researcher being “arguably less governed by an overarching awareness that they are embarked on a ‘project’” but that “The idea that research might be conducted under conditions of aimlessness and without a clear objective in mind does not necessarily mean that it lacks the rigours of ‘accomplishment and execution’ but that much of what is fashioned in the process is contingent on factors that cannot always be foreseen.” This is the stage I am at. Begun without knowing, I am now honing my objective and arranging my toolkit.
